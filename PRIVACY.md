1. Data Collection: FB Holopost does not collect, store, or sell any personal data, browsing history, or user identifiers. The extension only processes the specific text or image content that the user explicitly selects for analysis via the context menu.

2. Third-Party Services:
The extension uses the Google Gemini API to provide analysis. Selected content is sent to Google's servers for processing. Users are encouraged to review Google’s Privacy Policy regarding AI services. No API keys are stored on external servers; they remain local to the user's browser storage.

3. Permissions:

    activeTab & scripting: Used only to capture the selected content.

    storage: Used only to save user preferences and the API key locally.

4. User Rights:
Since no personal data is stored, there is no data to delete or export. The extension can be removed at any time, which wipes all local settings.
